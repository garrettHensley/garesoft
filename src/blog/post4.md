Yeah so uh, its been a minute. I really fell off, not entirely, but more or less I was getting burnt out by the
complexity of the spaghetti sauce(This is My Temple codebase) that I have created for myself.

Alright some big things I've been doing in 2025, mind you I started This is My Temple at the beginning of this year. So yeah here goes.

- Beat Half Life 1
- Beat Half Life 2
- Beat Portal 2
- Completely ditched Windows in favor of Linux (I use arch btw btw)
- Launched an in-house app at work. Not exactly my *magnus opum*, but it is quite literally what I was hired to build
- Started playing TTRPGs with the gang again (we are playing mothership)
- Aaaaand, started two side projects. Spoiler alert: **they suck ass**.

*So yeah thats basically the gist of it.*

### Side Projects
First lets talk about my side projects. So as I mentioned before, I was getting burnt out with This is My Temple. Largely because it is my first game,
and I feel like I have **coded myself into a corner**.

However, I had built up so much steam(heh) in Godot. I had learned so much since the beginning of the year.
And I did not want to risk losing that steam, by truly burning out and stopping. (I want to add that I work full-time as a programmer.)

So you know what I did? I took that steam and started a new project. It was sick at first. I had a lot of cool ideas.
It was going to be wayyyy smaller in scale from This is my Temple.

... Until it wasn't. But not only was the scope growing... this new side project that I was creating, was not fun.

It wasn't a game that I wanted to play. Which totally contrasts with how I started This is My Temple. TiiMT began as a concept proof. I wanted to put this idea I had in my head to code.

And i did exactly that! But something *different* occured. I *liked* playing it. *I wanted more*. 

I have started many tiny code projects, but I never had that feeling like I did with TiMT. I needed to make the game, because this game is the game that I want to play.

And that's what was wrong with my first side project. It wasn't fun, and it was not going to be fun.

And same thing with my 2nd side project, lol. That and the actual scope of this project was increasing, where the only fun to be had was over this massive mound of **work**.

#### I showed a friend of mine, TiMT
I showed them a small gif of the game. It had been a while since I actually looked at it. But that feeling, that burning feeling came back to me.

I thought to myself, as I was showing them. *This looks... good. I want this.*

And so, for the first time on my fresh linux install. I booted up This is My Temple. I did a little tour of the level. And damn. 

I have a lot here. And not only do I have a lot here, I also have a clear written path for myself towards what I consider a playable demo.

I know how to do this. I want to do this.

And so I am doing this. This week, I have started working on TIMP for the first time since March. Currently I am building out the simple skill learning system.

For the demo, I want you to have some sortof simple skill tree, so when you level up you can gain different abilities. Ensuring that each run of the demo can have variations.

And then once that's done? It's literally smooth sailing. No more thinky thinky bits. Only worky worky bits. Like drawing up new enemies, new bosses, creating a few items and abilities here and there. I have systems that I have built, so these things should couuld easy.

So yeah. Playable demo **2025**.

As always, thanks for coming to my TED talk. Be gareful out there, folks ;)
