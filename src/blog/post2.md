# This Is My Temple
#### *A look at my game This Is My Temple. A number crunching dungeon crawler inspired by dark fantasy classics.*

This Is My Temple is inspired by dark fantasy and dungeon crawler classics as well as traditional roguelikes.

TIMP follows the classic dungeon crawling setup, but with a real time twist. Time only moves when you do. Grow in power as you explore and gain levels and collect loot.

I am not an artist by any means, but I have been working on carving out my own *non-artist programmer style*. My main inspirations for the living creatures in this game are *Pizza Tower*, *Ren & Stimpy*, and *Ed, Edd, and Eddy*.

Here is slimey.

*Slimey is the 3rd creature that I have added to TIMP.*

I have experimented with rendering 3D models to ultra downscaled sprites, with some success. I like the way these look on animated creatures, but I'm afraid if I had any creatures who were made in 3D, then the rest of the games sprites should probably follow. *The two styles don't match up well.*  
But I might put this style in my pocket for a future project. It's super fun. At least in the meantime I can use this style for static objects, I think thats a fair trade-off.

### Anyways, heres some peaks at This Is My Temple.
