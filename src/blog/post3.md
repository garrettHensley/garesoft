Previously when you would kill an enemy, a meatpile would not appear. Now when you kill an enemy, a meatpile will drop on the floor where it stood.

In addition to dropping meatpiles, enemies can now drop *things*. These *things* can be but are not limited to: keys, equipment, feelings of existential dread that grind you down until you are nothing, potions, and experience.

*Witness the courtyard key, a thing that can be picked up.*

*And the illustrious tunic. Yes, bask in its glory.*

*A different view of the castle, from last weeks post.*

*Lastly here is the meatpile in action, dropping from Slimey. Also first time posting gameplay footage so that is kinda cool.. if you dare.*

Didnt get quite as much done this week as I wanted to, but hopefully ramping up to get a demo out shortly. I think I am close.

In summary:

- Added meatpiles to the game
- Enemies drop items
- Items can be used or equipped
- Ego Death
